				<p>I am currently in management for Home Depot. I have been in my current field for 10 months. Before that, I was in law enforcement as a corrections officer. I also worked at a facility for at-risk youth. I am seeking to move into the IT world. This is my third class with Tech901.</br> My superpower is my ability to see the best in others. I can see the potential in others and, therefore, motivate them to be the best they can. I also have creative ideas for solving complex issues and problems.</p>
